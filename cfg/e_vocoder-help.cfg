name=e_vocoder
description=This is a Fourier-based "vocoder" (perhaps better called a "timbre stamp") like the one the Convolution brothers use. The "control source" is analyzed to get its spectral envelope, which is then stamped onto the "filter input" by adjusting the amplitudes of its Fourier transform. The "filter input" is first whitened. The best value of "squelch" to use depends critically on what kind of sounds are used for the filter input and the control source.
