type=message, float
description=message to output the stored pattern using the following transformations. bang -> original. retrograde -> reverse the pattern. inversion -> invert the pattern melodically using its first element as inversion axis. inversion <num> -> invert the pattern around an arbitrary axis. transpose <num> -> transpose the pattern up or down. retro-inversion -> reverse and inverse the pattern around its last (i.e. the reversed first) element (= retrograde + inversion). retro-inversion <num> -> reverse and inverse around arbitrary axis. rotate <num> -> move <num> elements from front to back.
