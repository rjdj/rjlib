description=The g_synthcontrol is a special GUI set up to control many of the synthesizers in the rj library. It provides a set of 36 sliders arranges in groups of 4 on a 3x3 grid. 
The upper row is intended to control three Envelope generators with four parameters each, typically these will be ADSR values. The individual envelope sliders send and react to messages tagged with "env" + <envelope number> + <"a", "d", "s" or "r">. For example the second slider in the middle envelope will be tagged as "env2d" for decay. Label and color of the slider can be set with "env2d label <MYLABEL>" rsp. "env2d color <num>" messages. The same naming system applies to the next two rows, but instead of "adsr" here we use "abcd" like in the alphabet. 
The second row controls Oscillators. The tags are made up like above but with "osc" instead of "env" at the message start and use alphabetical "abcd" instead of "adsr".
The third row controls Modifiers. The tags are made up like for Oscillators but use "mod" instead of "osc".
All sliders have a range of 0 to 1
