[patch]
name=a_onset
description=[a_onset] is a very simple and fast audio onset detection. It compares changes in the input signals level with a reference value (the sensitivity) and sends a bang, whenever the changes exceed the reference level. Changes are measured as differences between two successive output values of an envelope follower [env~] analysis. The default sensitivity value is 25, it can be changed through the second inlet or with the second argument. The analysis windows size of the [env~] object can (only) be set with the first argument, which has to be a power of 2 (like 64, 128, 256, 512 or 1024).
When "compensate" is set to 1, [a_onset] will delay the input signal by <window size> samples before sending it to second outlet. Default is compensation off.
