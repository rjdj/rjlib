name=c_lfo
description=c_lfo generates message oscillators in various waveforms. The first inlet accepts a float to set the frequency of the LFO. If the frequency is 0, the lfo will be turned off, frequencies unequal to 0 will turn it on. To manually switch on or off the LFO, send an "on 0/1" message to he second inlet. The second inlet also accepts other messages to change various internals. Supported waveforms are saw (default), sine and tri (triangle) waveforms. They all extend from 0 to 1 It's possible to set the update period in milliseconds by sendung "updates <num>" to the last inlet, default is 10 msec. To set the phase of the LFO use a "phase <num>" message to the second inlet.
