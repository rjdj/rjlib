name=c_mfade3
description=[c_mfade3] allows one to crossfade three signals, mixing each possible pairs (ab, bc, ca). The last inlet selects the active mix: 0 ... 1/3 will fade signals (a) and (b), 1/3 ... 2/3 will mix (b) and (c), 2/3 ... 1 will mix (c) and (a). The control inlet is wrapped so it repeats with values larger than 1.0. The mixing uses linear interpolation.
