name=e_graindelread
description= e_graindelread reads from a delayline as created by Pd's [delwrite~] object. There has to be exactly one [delwrite~] available that has the same name as the second argument of [e_graindelread] specifies. You can create many [e_graindelreads] reading from the same delayline, though. The object delays and granulates the delay line data with grains shaped from a raised cosine curve. The width of the cosine peaks can be set with the "bw" parameter. As the object has many parameters, a way to "save" the settings to the last outlet is built in. Use [u_cocollect] to store them into a message box for example.
