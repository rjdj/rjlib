name=c_multimetro
description=[c_multimetro] is a metro that also includes a counter. The counter step is sent to the outlet. The counter is a modulo-counter, of the first argument "pattern length" is larger than 0, otherwise the counter is unrestricted. [c_multimetro] supports irregular beats by sending a list with more than one number to the second inlet.
A period list like "200 300 400 150" is interpreted as: duration of beat0==200, duration of beat1=300, duration of beat2=400, duration of beat3=150 and so on for beat([modulo pattern length] modulo period list-length).
