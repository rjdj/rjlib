description=[c_multipass] lets a message pass according to a probability percentage set as a list through the last inlet. The first message in that list gives the probability for messages starting with 0, the second is for messages starting with 1 and so on. 100 % passes always, 0 percent passes never. The outcome is the incoming list with its first element split off.
