[patch]
name=e_noclickdel
description=e_noclickdel is a tap from a delay line with an adjustable delay time that doesn't introduce audible clicks when changed. Note that you will hear clicks if the delay time is being changed too often, try using m_speedlimit to control it. The declick latency controls the speed of the declicker inside the object and will affect how fast the delay time is allowed to change. The default value is 200 msec, so that changes in delay times will only be registered every 200 msec. Smaller values increase the risk of clicks.
